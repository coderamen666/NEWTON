This is the readme file for NEWTON, a 2nd order numerical ODE solver that uses RK4.

It is called NEWTON for a very simple reason: you can use it to solve Newton's 2nd law!
That is the reason I originally wrote it, although it is good for other uses too!

The source code consists of 2 files:
	newton.h - Header file w/ documentation
	newton.c - Implementation of the solver

Read newton.h for API documentation. It is all in there.

BUILDING:
Generally speaking, you can integrate NEWTON directly into your existing source code
with very little difficulty. This is the recommended way to use it.

If you want NEWTON as a static library, you can use these commands:
	gcc -c newton.c
	ar rcs libnewton.a newton.o
OR, if you want NEWTON as a shared library, you can compile it with this command:
	gcc -shared -o libnewton.so -fPIC newton.c
Using NEWTON as a library (shared or static) is NOT recommended.

And as for licensing/copying:
You can consider it as public domain for all intents and purposes.

With that being said, I request that you do not remove my name from any of the files.
I also request that you do not use it for evil (fascism, genocide, state terrorism, etc.)
I can't go after you if you do those things, but that still would make you a jerk! 3:<
